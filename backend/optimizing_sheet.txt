1 - OPTIMIZE HOW TO INTERACT WITH DICTS

    i should update how i work with dictionaries in the project, i should optimize
    the code to be more Python-like for example instead of doing this:

    `attr = object.attr`

    i should do this :

    `attr = getattr(object,"attr", "None")`
    and also using setattr,hasattr and their similares
