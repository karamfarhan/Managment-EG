1 - OPTIMIZE HOW TO INTERACT WITH DICTS

    i should update how i work with dictionaries in the project, i should optimize
    the code to be more Python-like for example instead of doing this:

    `attr = object.attr`

    i should do this :

    `attr = getattr(object,"attr", "None")`
    and also using setattr,hasattr and their similares

2 - I HAVE TO OPTIMIZE OUTSTANDING AND BLACKLISTED TOKEN

    right now the rest token mechanism is is bad i have to make sure that the
    token that are not used anymore is blacklisted and also what about if someone keep login
    in this case it will always create new refresh token and that will fill up the
    database so i have also to maybe check if the user have already a valid refresh token
    and send it back to the suer instead of creating a new one or just delete the old once and send a new one,
    also i have to make a endpoint so that when the admin de active any user i need to
    go and check if the user have any outstanding tokens and blacklisted them.
    or just make it on the User model save method.
    or maybe i should delete all the refresh tokens the user have when he make logout
    but in this case i have to check and delete only the expired tokens not the vlaid ones
    and blacklisted the vlaid ones

    or maybe if used the other token implementation it will be better isntead of using
    access token and refresh token, i mean usiing slidbs or like this becuase
    It means that you need to refresh every 5 mins (payload.exp)
    and even you keep on refreshing token every 5 mins,
    you will still be logout in 7 days after the first token has been issued (refreshExpiresIn).
